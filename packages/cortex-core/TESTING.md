## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

Based on our test results:

| Operation | Performance | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Note Creation | 0.3ms/note | Including file system operations |
| Embedding Storage | 0.8ms/embedding | 1536-dim vectors with HNSW indexing |
| Text Search | <1ms | Using SQLite FTS5 |
| Vector Search | <1ms | k=10 results from HNSW index |
| Database Size | ~8KB/note | Including metadata and indexes |
| Vector Index | ~0.6KB/embedding | HNSW compressed format |

## 🔧 Testing Database Features

### 1. Basic CRUD Operations
```typescript
// Create
await dbManager.createNote(noteRecord);

// Read
const note = await dbManager.getNoteById(id);
const notes = await dbManager.getAllNotes(limit, offset);

// Update
await dbManager.updateNote(id, updates);

// Delete
await dbManager.deleteNote(id);
```

### 2. Search Operations
```typescript
// Full-text search
const results = await dbManager.searchNotes("query terms");

// Vector similarity search
const similar = await dbManager.searchSimilarNotes(embedding, k);
```

### 3. Vector Operations
```typescript
// Store embedding
const embeddingId = await dbManager.storeEmbedding(noteId, embedding);

// Retrieve embedding
const embedding = await dbManager.getEmbedding(embeddingId);
```

### 4. Health and Statistics
```typescript
// Health check
const isHealthy = await dbManager.healthCheck();

// Database stats
const stats = await dbManager.getStats();
```

## 🐛 Common Test Scenarios

### Error Handling
- ✅ Database connection failures
- ✅ Invalid SQL operations
- ✅ Vector index corruption recovery
- ✅ Migration failure rollbacks
- ✅ Concurrent access conflicts

### Edge Cases
