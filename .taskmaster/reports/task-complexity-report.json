			"reasoning": "This task requires integration with multiple external AI services with different APIs and authentication methods. Implementing batch processing, caching, and retry logic adds complexity. The streaming response support for chat interactions requires careful implementation. Creating an abstraction layer that works across different AI providers is challenging."

			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the semantic search and RAG system into subtasks covering: 1) vector similarity search engine, 2) search ranking algorithm, 3) RAG context retrieval system, 4) response generation with citations, 5) search filters and metadata integration, and 6) search result caching and performance optimization.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex algorithms for semantic search, ranking, and retrieval-augmented generation. Implementing a system that effectively combines vector similarity with metadata relevance requires sophisticated ranking algorithms. The RAG system needs to retrieve relevant contexts and generate coherent responses with proper citations, which is highly complex."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Background Daemon Service",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the daemon service implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Node.js child process management system, 2) file system watching with change detection, 3) job queue system with priority handling, 4) health monitoring and crash recovery, and 5) IPC communication with CLI interface.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex process management, file system monitoring, and inter-process communication. Implementing a robust daemon that can recover from crashes and handle file changes efficiently is challenging. The job queue system with priority handling adds complexity, as does proper error handling and graceful shutdown procedures."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Terminal User Interface (TUI)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the TUI implementation into subtasks covering: 1) three-pane layout with Ink, 2) keyboard navigation and event handling, 3) markdown preview with syntax highlighting, 4) interactive search with real-time results, 5) chat interface with streaming responses, and 6) status bar and system indicators.",
			"reasoning": "Building a complex TUI with multiple interactive panes requires sophisticated state management and event handling. The vim-style keyboard navigation, real-time search, and streaming response display add significant complexity. Rendering markdown with syntax highlighting and managing the three-pane layout with proper focus management is challenging."

			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the git integration task into subtasks covering: 1) automatic git commit functionality, 2) sync command implementation for manual operations, 3) configurable auto-commit with message generation, and 4) conflict resolution and merge status reporting.",
			"reasoning": "While git integration is complex, the simple-git library abstracts much of the complexity. The main challenges are implementing automatic commits with meaningful messages and handling potential conflicts. The sync functionality requires careful implementation to prevent data loss, but overall this task is less complex than others in the project."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Offline Fallbacks",

			"reasoning": "Implementing comprehensive error handling across a complex application requires careful consideration of failure modes and recovery paths. The offline capabilities and queue management add complexity, as does the integration with local models as fallbacks. The health check system needs to monitor multiple components, increasing the overall complexity."
